# Web-Scrapping---Indeed.com
Scrapping data analyst/business analyst/product analyst jobs posted in California from indeed.com and plotting the same on the map of California

In this project, I wanted to showcase my abilities to get my own data through web scraping. For this project, I wanted to explore data analyst/business analyst/product analyst jobs posted in California on indeed.com, a job aggregator that updates multiple times daily. I conducted my scraping using the “requests” and “BeautifulSoup” libraries in python to gather and parse information from indeed’s pages, before using the “pandas” library to assemble my data into a dataframe for further cleaning and analysis.
